# 🧠 Assembly Refresher

Welcome to my personal Assembly language refresher repository. While I already understand core assembly concepts, this repo is a structured space for revisiting the fundamentals, reinforcing my low-level programming skills, and preparing for more advanced reverse engineering and exploit dev work.

---

## 📚 Goals

- Refresh foundational Assembly concepts (x86 and x86_64)
- Practice writing and debugging small ASM programs
- Explore different assemblers (NASM, GAS/AT&T, MASM)
- Reinforce calling conventions, stack frames, and memory access
- Write shellcode and understand syscalls in detail
